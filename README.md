A bit about me: Last night I went to a fencing class. It was totally fun! We got to learn three different swords, the foil, the saber and the ... it starts with an 'e' but I can't remember it. Not a word I use a lot. We put on arm guards, jackets, masks, and gloves. Then we picked up practice swords and started fencing. We did an activity to learn to move backwards and forwards real fast, and now my knee muscles are sore. But it was fun, and I'm glad I went. Good date night.
